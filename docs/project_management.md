## MCP Server Usage Guide

### Available MCP Servers
1. **GitHub MCP Server**
   - **Key Tools**:
     - Repository management (create, fork)
     - File operations (create, update, delete)
     - Issue & PR management
     - Search capabilities
   - **Important Notes**:
     - When updating files, you need the file's SHA (use get_file_contents first)
     - For create_or_update_file, branch parameter is required for non-default branches
     - Creating PRs requires changes in the source branch first
     - Search operations may have specific format requirements

2. **Filesystem (fs) MCP Server**
   - **Key Tools**:
     - read_directory
     - get_file_info
     - write_file
     - delete_path
   - **Important Notes**:
     - Always use full paths from project root
     - For delete_path, verify file existence first
     - JSON arguments must be properly formatted
     - Recursive operations need explicit flag

### Best Practices
1. **File Operations**:
   - Always verify file existence before operations
   - Use get_file_info before modifying files
   - Keep track of file SHAs for updates
   - Handle paths consistently (always from project root)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Check for proper JSON formatting in arguments
   - Verify branch existence before operations
   - Ensure required parameters are provided
   - Handle missing files gracefully

3. **General Tips**:
   - Use one MCP operation at a time
   - Wait for operation completion before proceeding
   - Keep track of branch contexts
   - Verify success of each operation
