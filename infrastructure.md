# WookieFoot Website Infrastructure

## Domain Configuration
- Domain: wookiefoot.com
- DNS Management: Cloudflare
- SSL/TLS: Managed through Cloudflare

## Deployment Architecture

### Server Infrastructure
- Self-hosted server
- Docker containerization
- Cloudflare tunnel for frontend access and security

### Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# TO BE IMPLEMENTED
# Will include:
# - Node.js runtime
# - Next.js application
# - Web server (TBD)
# - Environment configurations
```

### Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
- Secure connection between Cloudflare's network and our web server
- No need for public IP or opening ports
- Enhanced security through Cloudflare's protection

## Deployment Process

### Container Management
1. Docker image build process
2. Container orchestration
3. Resource allocation
4. Health monitoring

### CI/CD Pipeline (To Be Implemented)
- Automated builds
- Testing procedures
- Deployment stages
- Rollback procedures

## Infrastructure Components

### Web Server (TBD)
- Options under consideration:
  - Nginx
  - Apache
- Configuration will be documented here once decided

### Security Measures
1. Cloudflare security features
2. Docker security best practices
3. Regular security audits
4. SSL/TLS configuration

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Container health monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Performance metrics
- Error logging

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups (when implemented)
- Configuration backups
- Content versioning

## Infrastructure Updates

### Version History
- Initial Setup (Current)
  - Domain registration
  - Cloudflare integration
  - Docker containerization plan

### Planned Improvements
1. Automated deployment pipeline
2. Enhanced monitoring
3. Performance optimization
4. Scaling capabilities

## Environment Variables
```env
# To be configured:

# Additional environment variables will be documented here
```

## Infrastructure Management Commands
```bash
# To be documented:
# - Docker build commands
# - Deployment scripts
# - Maintenance procedures
# - Backup/restore procedures
```
