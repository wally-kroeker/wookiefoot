Verse 1:
Walking down this road of life
Trying to find my way
Through the darkness and the strife
Living day by day

Chorus:
Be yourself, don't be afraid
Let your light shine through
Every moment that you've made
Is uniquely you

Verse 2:
In a world of endless noise
Seeking truth within
Finding peace beyond the void
Where does it begin?

(Chorus)

Bridge:
The answers that you seek
Are written in your soul
The strength you need to peak
Will make your spirit whole

Verse 3:
Time will tell the story right
As you find your way
Through the darkness of the night
Into brighter days

(Chorus)

Outro:
Be yourself, be true
Let your spirit shine
Everything you do
Makes this life divine
