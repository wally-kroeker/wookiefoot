Verse 1:
Floating through the cosmic sea
Waves of energy surround me
Ancient wisdom calls my name
Nothing here remains the same

Chorus:
On a cosmic journey now
Breaking through the veil somehow
Universal love and light
Guiding us through darkest night

Verse 2:
Patterns dance before my eyes
Sacred geometry in skies
Everything connected here
As the boundaries disappear

(Chorus)

Bridge:
We are one with everything
Dancing stars and cosmic strings
Time dissolves into the flow
As above, so down below

Verse 3:
Coming back to Earth again
Changed by what we've seen and been
Carrying the light within
Where does end and start begin?

(Chorus)

Outro:
Cosmic journey never ends
Round and round the spiral bends
Always moving, always free
Through the vast infinity
