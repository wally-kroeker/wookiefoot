Activist, pasifist, catalyst to wag a fist
Throw up your peace signs show me how you manifest
We all know those suffering for apathy are locked in a box
So show 'em that you have the key
Action reaction no satisfacion
Wheels keep spinnin but they get no traction

Buddha and Shiva and the elephant with six arms

All love jesus so put away your fire arms



Oh now people come together

Let's go down to the gateless gate

Slow down floatin like a feather

Come on superhero it's time to activate



There's cable and satelite and many types of kryptonite

Like moths around the firelight

Pull the plug and save your life

so stand up get up jump up and rise

Everybody look at everybody right in the eyes

Sit in the lotus maintain focus

Self disappearin like (whh!) hocus pocus

Swimmin in the deep end and leapin off the high dive

Call out to all bliss junkies now's the time
