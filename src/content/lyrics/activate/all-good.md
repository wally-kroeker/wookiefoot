Look we know exactly where you are
Can't get the lid up off the jar
Not feeling even what this world is offering
Cause suffering is life and all life is suffering
But all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Can forever be avoided with some brain contortion

so come follow me come let me help you up

Not just half full but really fillin up your cup

- You Have to Laugh - Out Loud - and Plead Insanity

To this alien nation [alienation] and inhumanity

Three little birds sittin on my line

So i put them in a cage and they sing all the time



If you super sad and fragile and accept your own prognosis

Your pychopharmocoligist can expedite your doses

If you want to understand how we say this elated

It's cause were medicated



It's all Good

Super sad and fragile and accept your own prognosis

Your pychopharmocoligist can expedite your doses



Please tell me more cause i've been depressed

And losing luminescense through self opression

And i guess i only have one question left

And what exactly is this pill?



Well, it's not just a pill it's a thought

that's consisting of all things being perfect

and bad not existing

cause everything negative and dark are lies

And it all goes away if you just close your eyes



But how do you grow if everythings perfection ?

Just throw away your mirror and you have no reflection



But without hate how can love be known ?

Just grab anyone's hand and you won't feel alone



But what about injustice and oppression and cancer ?

We don't ask those questions we don't like the answers



But what about that soldier face down in the mud ?

With rose colored glasses you can't see the blood



If you super sad and fragile and accept your own prognosis

Your pychopharmocoligist can expedite your doses
