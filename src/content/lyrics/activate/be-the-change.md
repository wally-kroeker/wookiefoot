You shake your fist at the waiting list
And still insist this big cruel world has passed you by
Sand moves fast through the hour glass and still another hour passes
You still just sit there gettin high
And your soul is thin cause everyday's so long
And you hide inside the thought of what went wrong

Like Sisyphus will push another boulder up that hill

They've broken your will

But you thought that it was fine

Thought you were still in line

But your killing all your time

yeah you are killing all your time



Ship got hit sinkin not to be saved

But everybody sat in place while the band still played

Now we're surrounded by waves and it's up to our ears

Cause it drowns your motivation, ampiflies your fears



They all died at twenty seven full of drugs insane

So i made a conscious change to make my role models change

Gandhi Dali Lama Mother T and Dr. King

Doesn't matter what religion they all say the same thing



You gotta be the change you wanna see in the world



I know it sounds strange cause i'm the first to complain

about this world full of depression and these people in pain

But it doesn't do much to sit around and bitch

If you wanna activate you gotta throw the switch



They all died at twenty seven full of drugs insane

So i made a conscious change to make my role models change

Gandhi Dali Lama Mother T and Dr. King

Doesn't matter what religion they all say the same thing



You gotta be the change you wanna see in the world



Stop killin your time
