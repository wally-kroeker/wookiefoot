Have I found Jesus? i didn't know he was missing
But i'm pretty sure he somewhere in this vicinity listening
And i don't know what happens after death or before birth
But Bob was right about heaven and hell being
right here on earth
And if Jesus is lost we should go check outside

Cause i think i saw him inside of a homeless guys eyes

And if that is what he is then we should both go help him out

Instead of sitting here shoving religion

into eachother's mouths



Cause when it's all said and it's all done

Can you truely love the man with his hand on the gun

Cause when it's all done and it's all said

Can you love him even with the barrel staring at your head



And so it was written and so it was written

On a crupmled up napkin on the floor of the kitchen

This bodys only rented and this world is fundamented

And so it was written and so it was written

On a crupmled up napkin on the floor of the kitchen

Said loves really is all you need

so go plant yourself some seeds



The end is near but the beginning is nearer

So grab the people that you love cuz they

will be your clearest mirror

And see the shadow moving in the corner of your eye

And catch those shadows moving in the corner of your eye

Cause a hundred year from now all the people will be new

So there's really only one important thing for us to do

And it's not from the thoughts of the things that you can't

But the echo from the tiny little seed that you plant



Cause when it's all said and it's all done

Can you truely love the man with his hand on the gun

Cause when it's all done and it's all said

Can you love him even with the barrel staring at your head



And so it was written and so it was written

On a crupmled up napkin on the floor of the kitchen

This bodys only rented and this world is fundamented

And so it was written and so it was written

On a crupmled up napkin on the floor of the kitchen

Said loves really is all you need

so go plant yourself some seeds
