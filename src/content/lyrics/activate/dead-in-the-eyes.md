I no longer see me in your eyes
so either i'm gone or your gone
Or both of us moved on
out of body float on ceilings
speaking nothing, sparing feelings
staring faces, dead in the eye

Killing time before we die



My foot hits the pavement and the concrete don't give

Not like the soft grass where i used to live

Go down to the corner store to buy a bottled water

Cause the shit from my tap's like it came from the gutter

Throw my hoodie cause it's gloomy and cloudy

Put on my headphones and zone out to Rumi

The man behind the counter man i think he's a saudi

Or some kind of suni he just looks right through me

Homeless man got enough change for a forty

Look at the clock and it's only 4:30

Avoiding my eye an old lady walks on by

(or) [A void in my eye an old lady walks on by]

She thinks all dreadys are shady and dirty

I go to get a sandwich from the girl at the deli

She reads a book written by Machiavelli

She won't even chance a glance

Lord it makes me want to cry

why everybody heres looking dead in the eyes



My foot hits the pavement but my toes they can't feel

How long have i been asleep at the wheel

Lord it into a mirror i don't know what to do

Cause i can see my eyes are dying too





Oh no one even flinches at the jarring

sound of screaming sirens

a mothers buying cigerettes can't even hear her child crying

Lady pay attention it's your own flesh and blood

What will it take to make you wake up other than a Flood

Feeling suffocated all the sounds start to drone

Alone around this crowd i'd rather hide inside my home

So in a rush to go to somewhere else I lost my focus

and now i'm steppin over a homeless man

I didn't even notice



My foot hits the pavement but my toes they can't feel

How long have i been asleep at the wheel

Lord look into a mirror i don't know what to do

Cause i can see my eyes are dying too
