These obstacle illusions man i know they cause you pain
But poisoning your well, lonely living life in vein
Oh brother please brother please don't make that sound
Know that there is always further down
The dirty little secrets and the lies you tell yourself

The biggest one to swallow is your not damaging anyone else

oh brother please please don't make that sound

Know that there is only further down



Lying in the basement thinking there can't be anymore

You've landed that rock bottom but still falling through the floor

And now you can not even trust the solid ground

Cause you know that there is always further down



If we sent you down a rope that could lift you up from harm

Would you stand up be a man and take that needle out your arm

And open up and feel the love that's always around

Brother please brother please just put it down
