Nobody knows how it goes in guantanamo
Terror level orange fear fall like dominoes
Leap but not looking let's jump geranamo
Nobody knows what goes in guantanamo
Machiaveli Machiaveli then i found a quite compelling

Story that the Prince is telling now becoming foul smelling

Justified and over selling listen to your own gut feeling

Conscious screaming now it's yelling

Good's not dealt from dirty dealing



Machiaveli Machiaveliyou can call us yellow belly

But from Bali to New Dehli people see what your revealing

See them rising from their kneeling

waking up from their unfeeling

Machiaveli's been dispelled by

trading vengence in for healing



Nobody knows how it goes in guantanamo

Terror level orange fear fall like dominoes

Leap but not looking let's jump geranamo

Nobody knows what goes in guantanamo
