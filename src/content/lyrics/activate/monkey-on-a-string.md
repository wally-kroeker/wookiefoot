I used to let it run saw that it was havin fun
Thought that it would get tired but it only just begun
Now i'm annoyed with the species as it's jumpin branch to branch
Or throw a little fieces, or do a little dance
And my mind isn't steady it's spinning like a top
Got tangents and they vanish into english or to spanish

And it never feels finished

I can almost touch the Grail

They monkeys in a circle and he's swallowin his tail

He's got his buddy's in a barrel and their arms are locked

I try to get one but only get the whole lot

I see the claws and the fangs and the riots on the way

Lord what i wouldn't give to get quiet for a day

Devouring itself but it can't feel the sting

And the thoughts keep on turnin till i think i thought of everything

Got to keep your monkey on a string



Meditate to make that Primate sing!
