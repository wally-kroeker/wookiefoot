Sittin on the beach in Sante Teresa
with my old friend St. Peter
He reached out his hand and peeled back the night sky
He pulled it aside like a black velvet curtain
That was studed with tiny little diamonds
He said come let's go and take a look outside

Floatin on the foam an angel appeared

in the form of a waveand whispered,

"We're the wave rollin in to the shore we're alive

But when it crashes there's an under tow

that's just as strong as the current

And your journey continues with the ebbin tide"



Jojo stokes the fire with the flute in his hand

I picked up my scattered thoughts i had strewn about the sand

And Mesqolito had desended in the spirit of a dog

And led me off into the jungle fading in the fog

was coming from the breath of serpant all around

unseen but clearly heard

I spin and fall and laugh and cry i hung on every word

He said "i'm the left hand of god

and i'm much harder to understand

While the right hand will coddle you like a child

i will push you to be a man

And all of the troubles in the world will fall upon my name

But if you drown in that mighty ocean

the ocean's not to blame"



[the leviathan is coming]
