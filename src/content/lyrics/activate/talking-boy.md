Here’s to the grass that grows through the
cracks of the pavement on the street find the weakness
and defeat the concrete
this is you're mother calling, who you’ve abused and uprooted
chopped down, bruised, polluted, and used any way you’ve
suited

you know that book where that Tree
gives that spoiled little kid
damn near everything he needs
limbs, branches, and leaves
while I’m hear to decree now, that that Tree is me
but now I’m only just a stump!

this self fulfilling Profit Margin
got no way to stop enlarging
Monkeys will piss in the well
where they get there drinking water from
and not even notice the smell…

you say you wanna save the planet but you
know you’re Mother’s planned it so that
She’s not the one who needs saving
so good luck with all of your paving
but you know that youi’ll be sorry when I’m…

gone just like that little punk
who cut down my trunk and carved me up
and sailed away that day i admit i really wish he sunk
cuz don’t forget in the end like destiny
he sat his ass on what was left of me
and sailed off int a strip mall sea
thinking, “Now where are my children gonna play?”

so here’s to the grass that’s growing throughout the cracks
and claim in the name of the Mother
the other side is fighting back
here’s to the grass that’s pushing up high
in that pace we used to call outside

you say you wanna save the planet but you
know you’re Mother’s planned it so that
She’s not the one who needs saving
so good luck with all of your paving
but you know that you’ll be sorry when I’m…
