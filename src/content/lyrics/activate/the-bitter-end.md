All dressed in black blockin traffic causing panic
And the protesters marching on energies manic
And fanatical radicals resisting the mechanical
Poisoning of our childrens minds to generate more capital
Understand and overthrow, pull them in the under tow
Let them know they can’t cut down the underprivilaged overgrowth
All dressed in black, a rock hid behind his back
And he’s jonesing for the moment when the cops come attack
And he pulls back his hand, and he let’s out a scream
‘You are forcing your nightmare into my dream!!!”
Down by his feet, a young girl dressed in white
Sat there praying for peace, but he paid her no mind
He said, “I will find you on the battle line
And I will fight you to the bitter end
And I know that Right is on my side
And I will hold you to the bitter end!”
All dressed in body armor, stead fast inside the clamor
He didn’t become a cop for the money or the glamour
But he did it to defend the Law and Order and he swore to defend
A dream his father fought and died for off in foriegn wars
“These ungrateful, unpatriotic Hippies are diseased!”
He wouldn’t have to beat them down if they would leave in peace
All dressed in body armor with his helmet and his shiled
And thirstin for the moment when the crowd refuses to yield
