Sit right back and you'll hear a tale let go your apprehension
cause it's time for the mind to join the self
inside this third dimention
Just gladiators battling on tv talk show drama
Politician preachin drow in dualistic instant karma
New milimiem light gonna shine

blind all of those with a black and white mind

Balance it on end and that's the thrid side of the coin



Antithesis and thesis are created by the tongue and shattered

words confine like prison bars

turned sideways become wrungs on ladders

Many well intentioned teachers try but they have lied because

I'm not speaking in metaphore becasue

a coin really has three sides

New milimiem light gonna shine

blind all of those with a black and white mind

Balance it on end and that's the thrid side of the coin



There's Father and there's Son but Holy Ghost he has the answer

For bipolar two dimension people spreading 2-D cancer

Take this coin inside your hand and now you'll never have to doubt it

No more need for fundemented warfare nothing fair about it
