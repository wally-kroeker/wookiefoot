This world full of suffering and violence
Lord i'm losing my will to try
I find when i finally find silence
I just hang my head down and i cry, i cry
Welcome home my son

You've been down such a long road

Come warm yourself by the fire

and rest your weary bones

welcome home

In your anger joy and sadness you will never alone

The road you walk is a circle and will always bring your home

Welcome home



Give what you can and take what you need

These arms are wide open and here when you need

I know you must go soon so go plant good seeds

And be careful which of the two wolves that you feed



(An old Cherokee was teaching his grandchildren about life. He said to them, "A battle is raging inside me ... it is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf represents fear, anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority and ego. The other stands for joy, peace, love, hope, sharing, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, friendship, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith." The old man fixed the children with a firm stare. "This same fight is going on inside you, and inside every other person, too." They thought about it for a minute and then one child asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win?"

The old Cherokee replied: "The one you feed." )
