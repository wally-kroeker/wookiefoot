Put those words in my mouth and i spit them right out
And your ear suddenly found that you're hearing how you sound
Don't you know that sometime soon your
house is gonna fall on down
And nothing that you can do can keep the

walls from crumblin to the ground

And is there something that i could say to

push past your condemnation

pick a hammer and knock away the

cornerstone to your foundation



Oh now here we go living in the prison of our own ego

falling like the wall of Jericho

really nothing short of a miricale

Oh now here we go how do we escape our own ego

black and white and right and wrong and

what are you afraid of that you can't let go



when you think you're disconnected

all inside you're imagination

self fulfilling prophet stop it

leave yourself disinigration

out beyond ideas of Right and Wrong there is a field

I promise that i'll meet you there

no aromor and no shield
