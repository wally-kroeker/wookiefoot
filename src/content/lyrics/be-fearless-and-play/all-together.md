Just because we think of treasure 
not in terms of gold and silver 
Doesn't mean that we don't have our wealth 
Some say we have lost it 
But know in a world gone mad 
Sanity is no real sign of health 



So drop your bags and drop your fears 

Lift your voice and voice your cheers 

Hoist your mug and give some hugs 

Shout your mantra sing your prayer 

Look around we're all right here 

It just proves we're not all there 



We may not have it all together 

But together we can have it all 



(Hi di-diddly-i dum diddly-iddle-idle-dum 

hi dum di diddly-i day) 



(Peewee Dread) 



The purpose of this life is to live a life with purpose 

So don't get trapped inside your safety net 

So fill you well and light your flame 

But go on seeking service 

Life with out a cause is life with out effect
