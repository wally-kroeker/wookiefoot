Up on a cliff i saw a tree grow out of a solid rock 
I follow the root back down and found how it had begun 
Somewhere a seed had some how slipped inside a secret crack 
And now the branches has reached up proudly for the sun 

so come on everybody put your hands in the sky 

And let out your mind and stretch out your spine 

Reach up like a tree with your limbs up high 

And bring in the light to your third eye sight 

bring in the light to your third eye 



Cause everything always is, always was, always will be alright 

Just because it's simple doesn't mean that it's easy 



Down in Cambodia i met a man who for most of his life 

Fought in the war for one side or the other 

But just hear his laughter and you'll know this soldier never sold his soul 

Although the senselessness had stole away his father and his brother 



Up on a cliff i saw a tree grow out of a solid rock 

The roots were clinging for life 

Saving it from certain doom 

But the tree had a limb 

That held a branch 

And the branch that held a twig 

And on that twig a beautiful flower bloomed
