Why do you throw stones at your own heart 
It makes us sad to see you this way 
These ideas that you still cling on to 
Don't belong to you 
Throw them away 
But our minds play tricks on us all 

Waiting for anything to catch your fall 

Sit a moment in silence 

There you can recall 

That the tide will rise 

And the tide will fall 

And the things that push on you 

You can't see them all 

And the moon will rise 

And the night will fall 

And the things that pull on you 

You can't leave them all 



So put your best foot forward 

And let's get out of here fast 

Cause your bones are healed 

So rip off that cast 

And let the past be the past at last 



You're thinking what are you gonna be doing when the pain comes back 

But it's just a shell that surrounds you understanding just got cracked 

Like a fruit will split, a seed will drop now will grow another crop 

Don't ever let it stop drop or roll you off the top 

Now you can see the season coming and going ebb and flowing 

And you know when it's snowing that the seed will soon be growing 

Winter into spring and summer into fall 

Got to love them all 



And you will rise 

And you will fall 

And the things that come at you 

You can't fight them all 

So don't fight at all
