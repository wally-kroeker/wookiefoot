these are no normal times my friends i can see the storm clouds gathering try to close your eyes to the ignorance and lies but it still feels like a heavy load greed and fear are the seeds that appear to have taken root through our garden right here

these sights and sounds were draggin' me down so i went out upon the road

i went out across the ocean out to Thailand and Cambodia out to Katmandu Sri Lanka through Tibet and then down to India and up on a hill in Rishikesh i came across a holy man with shining eyes and a toothless smile he grinned and this is what he said


"there's nothing so tall we can't climb over there's nothing so wide we can not cross the time has come to raise your voices the light burns brightest when all hope seems lost"



when i would play when i was a child i swore that i would never forget no i will never forget no

be fearless and play this is one thing that no one can ever take away
