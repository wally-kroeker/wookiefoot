damn, i see a crack in the dam
like a smack to the man
with his head in the sand
and his back to the facts
and his ass in his had
i said damn

i see a lack in this plan

and i don't understand what to do lord there's a crack in the dam



and when the dam breaks the water will fall

down will come all of what's built up behind that wall

it's been ringing and it's ringing

and we still missed that call

now we miss the ringing

bring a flood to us all



to the dam it seems that happens all of a sudden

but it really wasn't doesn't ever happen that way

years of pressure and decay

now is a critical moment

do you blame or do you own it

so now what you gonna do when the pressure drops on you



can you feel the pressure build behind the wall

it's coming for us all



dam there's a crack in the dam

like a smack to the man

with his head in the sand

and his back to the fact

and his ass in his hand

i said damn

there's a lack in this plan

and i don't understand what to do lord

help me make it through or just help me know just how to make it up to you

and give me one more chance to

try to put a patch on the dam
