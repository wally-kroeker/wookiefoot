Two men come and disagree to agree 
Both one to the other saying what should be 
Each climbing higher up self righteous towers 
And catapulting ?shoulds? back and forth just empowers them 
Don't get me wrong i'm the king of it 
Just a little bit hippy hypocrite winging it 

Sometimes thinking that i'm knowing everything of it 

And putting my should inside a song and singing it 



Should as it should maybe sounds absurd 

But should could be heard almost every other word 

When you should on your friends it's bad for the health 

But you got to be careful not to should on yourself 

These Towers of Babel all inevitably fall 

With cracks in the walls and the building implodes 

From the wreckage and rubble we rebuild another bubble 

Cause that's the way the monkey mind goes 



With a ?should do this!? and a ?should do that!? 

Everybody's just trying to do good 

But how many shoulds would a good man say 

If he could stop would he stop shoulds 

Oh my friend for the wounds to mend 

There's only one thing we should do 

Don't you should on me and i won't drop my shoulds on you 



Frequencies unfold in our numskulls 

Like a spark in a dark cave 

Where the light and sound waves 

Pave a way to mental higher ground 

All the little thoughts we collect 

Turned them into bricks with our intellect 

Build a tower in your hypothalamus and cortex 

Our own fortress in our cerebellum 

We can carry our convictions to the roof and yell 'em 

At the top of our lungs standing on the top rung
