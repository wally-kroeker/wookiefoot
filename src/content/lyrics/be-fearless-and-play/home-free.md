In every tribe only a few would wonder 
What's beyond that hill 
Who will go, fewer still you know 
And you'll find in every shape and every kind 
The reasons why now's just not the time to go 
But i say go and let your sail unfurl 

Go talk to strangers and see this beautiful world 



Home free that's where i long to be 

With a pack upon my back 

An open road in front on me 

And mister when you look 

No don't look down on me 

I'm not homeless no, i'm home free 



Years ago when i was sailing down the coast 

I met a man who had a boat in his back yard 

He worked on it for years, but it had never seen the water 

And now his life was ending and this just broke his heart 

He said now go and let your sails unfurl 

I say go talk to stranger and see this beautiful world 



Home free that's where i long to be 

(Kite) surfing on a beach 

In some beautiful country 

Mister when you look 

Oh no don't look down on me 

I'm not homeless, i'm home free
