to all the free range humans and organic life forms everywhere hold your forks up with solidarity remember you vote with your wallet your dollar bills your ballots alone its just a just a whisper but together you cant stop it

omg its the gmo's from the labs and tubes where the fast foods grow if you are what you eat then I'm a UFO hope to god my body still can decompose cause I'm biodegradable and your biodegradable and you'll find that the mind is highly persuadable

doesn't matter if you came through the canal or you're cesarean if you're an omnivore or maybe more a vegetarian you choose to eat an animal a vegetable a mineral eat what you are it's never been more literal
come chemical come dumbin' down the food chain come dumb us down whose super power seed grain come monsanto come with your new campaign all the politicians sing along with the refrain:



no more junk in my food we want it slow not fast like they grew in the past with green dream coming growing up in the youth please no more junk in my food



then mcdonalds got a farm gm gm gmo and on that farm he had a chicken and a cow but what they do now you really don't want to know why must we label it organic when that's the way we've been growing it for ten thousand years. i think the farm factory should label honestly to admit what they add genetically and chemically is there a bio engineer in the house is there a bio engineere i need some help with this label how do you say this? calcium poly phosphate? is this nutritional claim a fairytale or a fable 



then monsanto owned the farms gm gm gmo and on that farm he had a plant that won't produce a seed monopolize everything that grows they try to say that corporate way is efficient and worthwhile but the average meal that you eat traveled 1200 miles subsidizing never realize the price tag i wonder if my carrots get jet lag who makes a fruit that doesn't have a seed its the man in the suit with his arrogance and greed getting rich and leave his fellow man in need
