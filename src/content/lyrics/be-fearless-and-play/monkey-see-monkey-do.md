monkey see monkey do monkey i see you
i come and visit you in prison in this mess up zoo
i wanna open up the cage but afraid of what's it gonna do
i really don't think here on the outside's very good for you

and maybe hear no evil see no evil maybe evil too

but i need to smile for awhile with the denial of a fool

cause if i see it all I'll go crazy lock me up in a padded room

i don't know maybe let me in your cage and live inside with you



you can't do nothing

but there's nothing you can do

i said you can't do nothing

but there's nothing you can do



this lesson of acceptance is what I'm going through

you can't do nothing

but there's nothing you can do
