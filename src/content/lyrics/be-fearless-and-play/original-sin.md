show me that sin that's original
eating from that tree and mankind will fall
kicked out from that garden he built a wall
where does it come from
where does it come


come cherubim with your flaming sword

you see I'm not afraid i still march towards ya

have no blame i know you're under orders

what do you say that you guard it for



red apple, blue pill, knowledge gained, blood spilled

in the name of the father he's bothered by free will

doing time for that crime think my answers cheated you

but if i had that choice i would have been eaten too



(pewee dread)



why did you kick us out of the garden

why did you kick us from the garden



i just want to come back home
