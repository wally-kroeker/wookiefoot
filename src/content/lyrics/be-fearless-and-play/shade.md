Why not make a change in your life 
It's not that hard to become who you are 
Why not make a change in your life 
It's not that hard to become who you are 

He was afraid of his shadow run from his shadow 

Shaking roll and rattle always picked the wrong battles 

Never won, never once thought that he should slow down 

So he ran and he ran and he ran till he can't stand 

Damn need a plan look down upon the ground 

But there it was, his shadow was there 

So he ran till he died 

Silly man 



If you just sit under a tree in the shade 

Watch your shadow slowly fade away 

Sit in silence soaking up some shade 

See your shadow slowly fade away 



To the man with the hammer 

Every problem is a nail 

And it really never fails 

Always builds is own jail 

With a cell, with himself 

Where he hides from the world 

And he slams and he slams and he slams 

With his hammer and still no plan 

Look down around his cell 

But there he was, his shadow was there 

So he hid till he died 

Silly man
