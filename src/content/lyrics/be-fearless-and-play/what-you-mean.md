When the day is long but something feels wrong 
And i just can't seem to put my finger on it 
Same old cloud still follow me around 
Try to listen to my own advice 
But still falling down trying 
Tears of a clown still crying 

Outside fine but inside dying 

Soundly she puts her arms around me 

Pulls my head against her chest 

And says please my love please rest your mind 

This life is but a dream 

Know you're not alone because i know what you mean 



Look at you there's no surprise 

Don't like when it's sets but loves when it rises 

Look at me always waking up late 

So it seems sunsets are strictly my fate 

And look at you with the love in your eyes 

And waiting for what's coming over the horizon 

Look at me got stuck up a tree of 

knowledge of good and evil never helped me
