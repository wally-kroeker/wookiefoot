I'm climbing out of this hell hole 
 
I'm going to cut my apartment adrift 
 
I know it can be done I read how no one did it 
 
He packed up all his sh** by two 
 
Got two cans of beer two rolling papers 
 
Maybe I should stop by the zoo 
 
And I'm leaving you can't stop me 
 
Goodbye I'm sailing away 
 
Every cold morning dad went off to work 
 
With his straight jacket and tie 





 
His case was brief his logic was simple 
 
And he's never seemed bothered with why he did it 
 
I never could remember the morals to the stories 
 
And I never did learn how to sing 
 
You said there's no such thing as god 
 
Said there's no such thing as Santa 
 
But you never did say who there was such a thing 
 
And I'm leaving you can't stop me 
 
Goodbye I'm sailing away
