I can feel the heat of his breath on your neck bone 
 
Starin' in the silence to the bell on the telephone 
 
Pick the pretty flowers pay a price for you vanity 
 
Chokin' back the blame cause you seen her insanity 
 
My God, where's the humanity 
 
I'm just the guy who watches tide 
 
Sometimes she come low sometimes she come high 
 
Better you just forget her she gonna wash away your pride 
 
Too late I guess I am just content to watch the tide 
 
She's always right in the wrong way 
 
Always so right in the wrong way 
 
She's always right in the wrong way 
 
Always so right in the wrong way 





 
With the sweetness of her kiss the magic of the trick to get me to believe 
 
I guess I must be over it cause I see what's up the other sleeve 
 
Pack up my bags on my way out to feeling fine 
 
Hang my head in sorrow for the next guy she's got in line 
 
He's gonna be out of his mind 
 
Kick myself I should have known the words already spoken 
 
When I love something I let it go if it comes back it's broken 
 
Kick myself I should have known the words already that spoken 
 
When I love something I let it go if it comes back it's probably broken
