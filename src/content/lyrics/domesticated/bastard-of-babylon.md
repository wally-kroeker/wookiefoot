My, my, my...

(No, no, come in, come in, come in...)



My grandpa fought in World War II

He was such a noble dude

I can't even finish school

Missed my mom and left too soon

His dad was a fireman

Who fought fires so violent

I think I bored my therapist

While playing him my violin



(Oh my God)

That's so insane

(Oh my God)

That's such a shame

Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand

But I can't help myself from feeling bad

I kinda feel like two things can be sad

(1, 2, 3, 4)



The world's smallest violin

Really needs an audience

So if I do not find somebody soon

(That's right, that's right)

I'll blow up into smithereens

And spew my tiny symphony

Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you



My grandpa fought in World War II

And he was such a noble dude

Man, I feel like such a fool

I got so much left to prove

All my friends have vaping friends

They're so good at making friends

I'm so scared of caving in

Is that entertaining yet?



(Oh my God)

That's so insane

(Oh my God)

That's such a shame

Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand

But I can't help myself from feeling bad

I kinda feel like two things can be sad

(1, 2, 3, 4)



The world's smallest violin

Really needs an audience

So if I do not find somebody soon

(That's right, that's right)

I'll blow up into smithereens

And spew my tiny symphony

Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you



Somewhere in the universe

Somewhere, someone's got it worse

Wish that made it easier

Wish I didn't feel the hurt

The world's smallest violin

Really needs an audience

So if I do not find somebody soon



I'll blow up into smithereens

And spew my tiny symphony

All up and down a city street

While tryna put my mind at ease

Like finishing this melody

This feels like a necessity

So this could be the death of me

Or maybe just a better me

Now come in with the timpanis

And take a shot of Hennessy

I know I'm not there mentally

But you could be the remedy

So let me play my violin for you
