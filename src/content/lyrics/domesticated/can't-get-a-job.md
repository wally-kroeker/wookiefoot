I am the modern model of the modern model citizen 
 
But every now and then I have to question what I'm living in 
 
Another day another dollar take it for example 
 
Business minded kindness blinded by a need to trample 
 
Now I find myself as unemployment as my lifestyle 
 
Running out of money and I'm livin' like a slob 
 
Can't get the honeys 'cause I'm running out of Lifestyles 
 
Don't think it's funny 'cause I can't get a job 
 
Well I can't get job 'cause I can't afford to work 
 
Got no money for the bus Gus 
 
Let's discuss if we must the cycle that won't allow me nothing cousin 
 
Hey I got no loot so I can't get nice clothes 
 
Got no new clothes so I can't get no interview 
 
Got no interview so I can't sell myself 
 
Got no job so I don't got no wealth 
 
Got no wealth which means no car no house no bar with 
 
No bottles to put on a shelf 
 
Got no money so I can't get a haircut 
 
Can't get a haircut so I can't look nice 
 
Got no cheese so I can't catch the mice 
 
That don't even live at my home address 
 
I don't no dough so I can't get no bread to bless 
 
I can't get a job I can't get a job 
 
I can't get a job I can't get a job 'cause I can't afford to work 
 
I got no credit cause it takes it to get it 
 
That's making me dread it so I did 
 
Don't want a job to define me not till I find me 
 
My dreads will remind me that I'm just a kid 





 
As they did the other day when I went to see the man 
 
Late to the meeting and he didn't understand 
 
Never on time 'cause the watch doesn't ring wear me 
 
Never had time 'cause it's just a theory ethereal 
 
Like the goddess of material wealth 
 
She can keep it for herself 
 
In a daze through the maze so that you can get a raise 
 
While the suits say who goes who stays 
 
Back to the start lose a turn 
 
Give thanks and praise there are better ways to learn 
 
Thinkin' that you earn should be concerned 
 
Put your soul on hold then it needs to be returned 
 
I can't get a job I can't get a job 
 
I can't get a job I can't get a job 'cause I can't afford to work 
 
I said I can't get a job cuz I can't get a reference 
 
I can't get a reference cuz I don't have a phone 
 
I can't get a phone cuz I got no place to put it in 
 
I got no place to put it in cuz I'm without a home 
 
I can't get housing if I've got no history 
 
I can't get a loan cause I'm always alone 
 
I can't go to the bank with my nappy, nappy dreads 
 
I can't undo my naps 'cause I can't afford a comb 
 
I can't get a job 'cause I got no drivers license 
 
And the People there can't help me 'cause I got no id 
 
They're the ones trying to tell me that I got no identity 
 
But they're the ones working at the f%$king DMV 
 
Aw excuse me as I babble on and on
