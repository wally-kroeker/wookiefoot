I try to walk away and she comes runnin'.
I try to get in close, she runs away.
She'll do anything you want if you are leavin'.
That is, anything you want until you stay.
I found the combination to her little safe once,

but everything inside it turned to dust.

She says its only for the best to never read it,

I think she thinks its for the best to never trust.



She looks so good from afar,

but she's so far from good.

It takes a whole lot of shit to make her cry.

I tried to get inside, I don't think that you could.

She looks good from afar,

but she's so far from good.



Someone in her past had done some damage.

Someone beat up on a little girl.

I don't know who or when it happened,

but I see the price for being pretty in this world.

It takes a whole lot of strength to hold that shield up

and every now and then I catch a peek.

I guess she's saving up for someone that'll hurt her.

I guess I sometimes wish that someone could be me
