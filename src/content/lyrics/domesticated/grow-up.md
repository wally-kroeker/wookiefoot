I got no direction I got no bearing or course
Didn’t get instruction with this life it’s such a bore
Gradually I graduated high school finished me
Didn’t change me one degree and now
I think I am what I’m gonna be
when I grow up

I got no salvation I got no life after death
never found the promise land cause I ran out of breath
I’m not from the chosen trip no master plan for me
I guess fate has set me free cause
I think I am what I’m gonna be
when I grow up
