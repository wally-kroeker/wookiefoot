I have to laugh I have to laugh 
I have to laugh I have to laugh 
It never will be as bad as you think 
You have to laugh you have to laugh 
Well I might live to be 105 or I might die tomorrow 
But life ain't easy like a Sunday morning 
So I beg stole and I borrowed 
So if you've got maybe a second or two 
And you don't have the will too work hard 
Take a drink take a smoke take whatever to make you cope 
And get a play well with others on your report card 
I have to laugh I have to laugh 
I have to laugh I have to laugh 
You have to laugh you have to laugh 
Never will be as bad as you think 





You have to laugh you have to laugh 
Don't you know your paranoia is only coming up to destroy you 
If you wanna stay out the clinic be euphoric schizophrenic 
Well I might live to be a wise old man 
Or I might die a jacka** 
But if Buddha was right about coming back again 
You better believe my a** will be back fast 
'Cause after d**h they never had any fun 
They only sit around and pray hard 
Take a drink take a smoke take whatever to make you cope 
To get a play well with others on your report card 
I have to laugh I have to laugh
