I, I let you drive around my mind
I can't count the times you made me feel like I'm nothing
Played me like a fool, like a fool

Saying, "Drink another whiskey
Pop another pill
Money makes you happy
Heaven isn't real
You won't find nobody to love
Because your heart's too broke"
Now I know

You ain't nothin' but a liar
Yeah, I walk right out the fire
Yeah, you try to keep me down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going higher
I can hear you in my head
In my bed when I'm dreamin'
You try to be my friend
But you're blowin' smoke
Oh, and now, I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar

You burned me one too many times
Like a devil in disguise, hiding your true colors
Just leave me alone
Keep leading me on

Saying, "Drink another whiskey
Pop another pill
Money makes you happy
Heaven isn't real
You won't find nobody to love
Because your heart's too broke"
Now I know

You ain't nothin' but a liar
Yeah, I walk right out the fire
Yeah, you try to keep me down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going higher
I can hear you in my head
In my bed when I'm dreamin'
You try to be my friend
But you're blowin' smoke
Oh, and now, I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar

If I was doin' what you do
Then you would swear I poisoned you

You're nothing but a liar (liar)
Yeah, I walk right out the fire (fire)
Yeah, you try to keep me down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going higher
I can hear you in my head
In my bed when I'm dreamin'
You try to be my friend
But you're blowin' smoke
Oh, and now, I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar
