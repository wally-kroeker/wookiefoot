Sometimes my thoughts go astray and i lose my place

I drift inside outer space and drink up the milky way

You can see a trace of it in my face as i kickback


and relax in a galaxy far far away



but my doctor said ?mark, you know you're fucking crazy



I mean you're awfully lazy and your purpose on this planets all hazy



If you just kept that receipt you can take brain you bought back



get that train of thought back by eating some over prescribed Prozac?



Doctor, I confess I live in sanity and I'll be there if you need me



So you should know before greedy HMO tries to bleed me



That your Freudian slip is showing and I know you've blown your own treaty



Just give all pills and keep that riot quiet



Keep them safe and warm inside the norm



Fuck that. I'll allow the crowd to think that I'm to proud



Excuse me I was just thinking out loud



I think therefore I am a philosopher said one time



Drawing a line between body and mind



But before he asked the damn question everybody was fine



What a crime how fast the dumb ass masses go blind just to pass the time



I think loud therefore I am loud to get the thought out



But back in class my sorry ass got bought out



conformed to the norm of silence within my shell Educating it's more like salivating to a Pavlovian bell!



color within the lines mark or you're not going to pass the course



And what the hell's that supposed to be



that doesn't even look like a horse that's it you get a D minus



Another example of the school boards finest



With so many people around it makes it hard to get it out

t sound like when you found it that you drowned it in your doubt



Fuck it, I allow the crowd to think that I'm to proud



Cause I'm thinking out loud
