The emperor is naked but he swears he wears the clothes 
 
And he's making the big decisions catching the tiger by his toes 
 
Check out the chicken little dreaming screaming skies are falling down 
 
Where the sound of sanity stops nobody knows 
 
And collectively our minds are getting lost 
 
And I know that being crazy gets you off 
 
So your honor I'm just part of humanity 
 
So then I guess I get to plead insanity 
 
Jah come from the sky and look me in the eye 
 
He say don't be afraid it's time to testify 
 
Making me all right so I don't get left behind 
 
I just make thank the all mighty for giving peace of mind 





 
I'm gonna plead insanity 
 
Sometimes I get so frantic sometimes I'm schizophrenic 
 
How do you sing along with a song that's so manic 
 
Well on judgment day I was late for my date at the pearly gates 
 
'Cause I just couldn't find transportation 
 
Cramming for the final I took a look at the good book 
 
But I'm afraid I got lost in translation 
 
I said, "God, you gotta be kidding me didn't you see 
 
All of us down here drowning in our vanity?" 
 
The heroes have all been shot and the monkeys are taking over 
 
So I guess we get to plead insanity 
 
Are you programmed to speak?
