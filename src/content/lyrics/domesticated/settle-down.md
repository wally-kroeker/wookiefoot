What I see is what I get 
What I see is what I get 
What we see it what we get 
And what I see is what I get 
 
What you see is what you get tell me I'm wrong don't even try it 
I won't even listen to your song long enough too see if your strong enough 
To justify it 
Just defy it is more like what your solution would be 
But in the space age you can't even place a face on the enemy 
So much stress in the contest everyone I know's life is a mess 
I can't even hear myself think over the hum of the f**ing fluorescent lights 
And too unwind I choose to go blind by having 
The local news cast her fear into me every night 
 
I need to settle down they say I need to settle down 





A pretty little wife that's stupid and kind 
A quaint little cottage too quickly go blind 
I need to settle down 
 
But what I see is what I get 
 
Once upon a hard time in a monstrous city in the warehouse district 
On a restricted back avenue at sundown a rundown bus pa**es you 
Haven't you seen through your designer sungla**es how the people 
Who ride inside can't scream cause their dreams like burnt ashes 
The wheel splashes a puddle on the a** of a h**n addict's mangy mutt 
That wakes up one of the fleas that lives back by his bu*t 
A terrible nightmare to become self aware as a flea 
As he screams, "I BELIEVE IN GOD BUT GOD DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ME!"
