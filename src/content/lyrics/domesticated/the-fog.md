It’s the buzzing of the lights

And all the hissing and all the glow

It’s the traffic and the panic when their damming up the flow

The beauty’s in the details she cuts me when I’m tight

I’m stressin' over lesson and so i quit on Friday night

Damn Monday's back so soon like a short nap

Didn’t even dream it seems to fly i guess the well’s tapped

Perfection is a verb i try it every day

But i get tangled up in words as if i have something to say

Try to get it back i dip my head and quick

Some one please bring the fog is getting thick

The fog is getting thick

It’s the buzzing of the lights

And all the hissing and the glow

Go back to blank slate table raza nothing that i know

I thought that i found love one time

I thought that i found truth

defining ruthlessness as pertaining to a general lack of Ruth

Damn what a mess I’m guessin' stressin' was my lesson

So i turn that crap right on his back and make this curse my blessing

When i love something i let it go

And sing that song i sang

But scooby not back to me like a broken boomerang

don’t want to get it back just dip my head in quick

dear go bring the fog is getting thick

The fog is getting thick

It’s the buzzing in the lights

And all the hissing and the glare

No reflection in the mirror no inflection in my stare

What happens to a child that suspends his disbelief

it climbs inside a bottle hide from rapist and from theif

Damn what a waste of time I thought i had it in my hand

I squeezed to tight and crushed it

Washed away like castles made of sand

solipsistic bubble trouble now i’m all alone again

stay up late and wait for epiphany to bring me home again

back to dementia, i gotta get back quick

some please send the fog is getting thick
