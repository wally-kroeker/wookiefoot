bomb hits the tower drains the superpower
building spilling out flame in a shower
innocence don't make sense they go out for us
with spirit getting buried in a cloud of dust
we scramble through the meaningless and look to religion
pray a holy man be sent with higher vision

hope he be a philosopher artist or musician

but only fear hits my ear through the radio transmission



all the kings horses and all the kings men

couldn't put it back to together again



when Rome was burning down Nero play his violin

listen low to hear the sound still echo in the wind

the asylum on the island though that no one could ever touch

no glutton snooze button cuz we already sleep to much

put the meaning in their sacrifice by waking the fuck up and asking

why does half the world hate out government so much



all the kings horses and all the kings men

couldn't put it back together again

don't put it back together don't put it in the back of your mind

if we go back to the beginning everything will work out fine

so don't be afraid
