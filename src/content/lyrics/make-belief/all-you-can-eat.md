[Verse 1]
The grass grows in the field and the cows eat all the grass
And I eat all the cows so I can have a big white ass
Attention Wal-Mart shoppers there’s a sale in aisle five
So get spastic with your plastic ain’t it great to be alive
[Chorus]
I said what a happy day at the all you can eat buffet
Just fill the whole damn tray at the all you can eat buffet
Let me hear you say “GO USA” at the all you can eat buffet
Just throw it all away at the all you can eat buffet
[Verse 2]
The cows grow in the field and the test tubes grow the eggs
When genetically perfected they won’t even need their legs
Get excited Wal-Mart shoppers there’s a new machine to buy
It gives you spiritual salvation only $19.95
[Chorus]
I said what a happy day at the all you can eat buffet
Just fill the whole damn tray at the all you can eat buffet
Let me hear you say “GO USA” at the all you can eat buffet
Just throw it all away at the all you can eat buffet
[Breakdown Verse]
Woke up one morning decided my "I" would make contact with
freaks that eyes often don’t have it
Woke up one morning decided my "I" would make contact with
freaks that eyes often don’t have it
Saw the glutton eyes that look away from pain
Try to satisfy their appetites in vain
Look into the eyes of a child to redeem
Sing: merrily this life is but a dream
