when i first found you thought of you got me so high
but i'm amazed at how quickly the hunger is leaving my eye
oh i think its time to
put you in a box in the clear bubble wrap
and store you in the garage next to this or to that

and we smile cause the pile it mile high in a stack

and the only thing i'm lacking is the thing that i lack 

which is enough



ten thousand years ago our fathers went astray

they made their own bondage just to find an easier way

i've had enough

eventually must seem to be enough

but it's never quite enough



do you remember when we first met i was just five years old

you were a big shiny toy and i would have sold my soul

you know it only took a couple years till want turned into need

and greed grew a twisted tree from such a simple seed

time to put you in the box in the clear bubble wrap

and i'll never be content without the thing that i lack which is enough



necesitamos cuidado con la verdad que compramos

cosas y mas cosas es el dios de los Estados

iglesias esta en el centro de ciudades de Latinos

aqui en el centro solo hay mercados



ten thousand years ago our fathers went astray 

sacrificing the balance around in pursuit of an easier way

you think you've got what its about

you think its about what you've got 

the pot has been boiling so slowly 

no ones even getting hot

i've had enough
