are you falling down drunk are you falling down trying
do you walk with the sheep do you roar with the lion
are you singing your war cry or are you just crying
if i'm not falling down drunk i'll be falling down trying
my old friend mick mcquire was the best man alive

till he traded in his sprit at the age of 25

now he hits from the bog as he sits on the floor

and he scored a lot of points on his nintendo 64



is the right to remain silent all you want? (hell no!)

is the television thinking all your thought? (hell no!)

is a man only worth what he's bought? (hell no!)

is the right to remain silent all you got? (hell no!)



i can't believe you're reading all these lyrics

thank you for taking the time we love you



my good friend michael conner at the age of 24

had sold himself to slavery to the ugly corporate whore

i don't know if its wrong but it doesn't feel right

to be in your Warrior Years and not looking for a fight



i'll scream it with Jah at the top of mt zion
