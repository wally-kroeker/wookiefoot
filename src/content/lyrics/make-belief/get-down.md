blame is as useful a tool as the time when you
swung with an ax to knock the fly off my forehead
worry prevents problems as often as coffins soften
the smack of the fact your forgotten when you're dead
wipe that smile this trial is crushing my memory failed
i nailed your foot to the floor again

i once was lost but now i've found there's no way around

i'm more lost than i was back in oregon



i wanna get down

don't make me laugh



they said they'd be home by nine but they lied

lay down try to sleep and repeat everything's gonna be fine

no headlights or sign of the car in the driveway

afraid and alone in this world and up way past my bedtime

she was just right here in the cereal isle

but she disappeared between the rushing knees across the floor again

i once was lost but now i've found there's no way around

i'm more lost than i was back in oregon
