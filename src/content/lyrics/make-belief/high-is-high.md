if this day got any worse i'd be dropping a verse
about a doctor and a nurse and a cop and hearse
but if its like a rehearsed where the meek get the earth 
and the last shall be first i'll be the front of the damn line
its time i find just how i resign go for yours cuz i don't even want mine
elated at being sedated a chillum of sativa and glass of wine

i just try to get mine



smoke so much that i don't know why 

on the way down high passed me by and i found that 

high is high

try to get higher but high is high

hand in the fire and you don't know why

look him in the eye just look him in the eye and i found that

high is high



good and plenty ripped and munching on some Ramen

on the couch next to me appeared the spirit of a shaman

saying, "the key's to be a monk, not just be a monkey, 

pissing away your bliss you're going to be a Bliss Junky"

so i fill her up a chillum and she takes a little hit and says,

"haven't you had enough of this shit,

you're going to huff and puff and blow your mind down"

and i said shut up and keep passing that pipe around



high is high is high is high...and high just passed me by



almost had a bad trip fell down

swimming in the silence drowning in the sound

of the voices in the other side of that curtain i'm certain

it's a bad place i've found

grab it by the horns ride it all around

umbilical cord tied me to the ground

but i took to much and cut it got so high

that i can't come down
