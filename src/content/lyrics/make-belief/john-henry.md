john henry had a hammer slammer through a mountainside his eyes
you'd see a new machine was coming running down his pride
in school they taught he was a hero throw yourself in front of never
stopping industry confused cuz in the end he died
some say I'm a steel driving man

really i drive steel

into holes hard enough to bust juices of passion through peels

for my zeal for the new deal

may combat depression of pockets for me and my queen

to get our ticket to a meal

so i feel

to beat the machine before the whistle squeals

i slang hammers

bustin rocks with human appeal

for no system will ever beat me

but the irony 

is competition will be the eventual death of me

so let's see

what the moral of the story be

empathy for machines created by self-reflections

or for those who lube societies with greed and misdirection

linked like chain gangs singing spirituals while death and infection

resurrection of the truth in the form of falsified fables and perceptions

enigmatic like holes that swallow the universe not to return

and in turn

conceal like mascara the biggest lessons to learn
