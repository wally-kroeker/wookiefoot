the early noon yawns i shake off my dreams
dreamt i was a dragongfly lying by a stream
but skin and bone awoke to my world of make believe
when i know i was a dragonfly dreaming that he's me
the playhouse comes to life so i stop to have a listen
riding down the sliding board and fly into the kitchen

where aimee's wearing fairy wings and cooking up some chicken (veg)

so i hit her with some glitter, "Murphy, stop being silly!"

outside on the lawn you can see Mr. Gone

and you know he's going off with the over-the-top-hat on

he got belief and disbelief its just placebo in a bottle

wookies always looking for the psychedelic throttle

cosmic swami got a message beaming in from outer space

theres a place on your face you can save the human race

its called a smile

the positivity will spread it takes a while

but the grin will turn an inch into a mile

and butterfly wings will be the style

all you got to do is just 



make believe



clouds floating by like elephants 

rainbow shining overhead must be heaven sent

don't dismiss or you'll miss all the relevance

when your belief's in your hands it's benevolence

glitter girl wakes in her room full of clouds

and it must be afternoon cuz the reggae's booming loud

Jojo blowing bubbles to the firmament

if you catch one in your hand it might be permanent

hat eine swanzig mark note und er brennt sie

this non sequitur the lesson but we're learning it turning it

inside out and upside down

abduction is the key to the door that goes underground

we found there's a river that ties it all together

and you gotta jump in even though you can't swim

and you drift to a cave where you're drowning in your doubt

but Shadow's got the lab coat on and he's there to pull you out

strapped to a table with your fear just remember that 

nothing ever is as it appears, the man in the 

mask removes your chip just in time

now you're initiated to the Undermind

its all just

make belief

the nighttime arrives the moon will inspire

a freak drum circle with fairies spinning fire

we chant down Babylon Marco drops a beat

Capt. Happy got a five-foot stilts on his feet

enter Mr. Bliss with Melissa the nurse

his license is poetic his verse unrehearsed

a candy necklace is a great sign of wealth in our tribe

and knowing is an omen when i see a buttlerfly by 

its all in my head is what my caseworker said 

and the knots in my brain grow out into dreads

Weedman's in his room just watching cartoons

i better get some sleep got to be up around noon

just close my eyes and wake up from my dream

and go back to being a dragongfly lying by a stream

believe it so i see its all

make believe
