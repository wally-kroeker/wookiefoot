in this cause too i am prepared to die
there is no cause for which i am prepared to kill
i am asking you to fight, to fight against the anger, not to provoke it
we will not strike a blow
if you stand for nothing

you can't fall for anything



no freedom gained when blood stained



what would you sacrifice for you to get your way have it made

hand on the mic what would you have to say any ways

any means necessary justified

slave becomes the oppressor when the master dies



an eye for an eye just leave us blind

for a story we already know 

history repeating we all get a beating

the angry just reap what we sow



Don't you know?

Can't you see?

There the sees, and the not sees

which one are you?
