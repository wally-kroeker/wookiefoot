nod my head when chalky finger pointing down
when condescending tone alone the only sound
when ruler hit my knuckle on the holy ground
when every time she talk about a wedding gown
its not in the words that your singing
it’s the way that you sing their song
nails on a chalkboard its got my head ringing
and I’m not going to sing along

i just nod my head

no love in his heart no beat in his chest
but he’s saving all his change to buy bullet proof vest

i look around this world for some guidance
the far corners where Nothing is said
looking for old men sitting on mountains in silence
Dalia Lama gives a smile and he nods his head

so i nod my head
