and if you can't stand the pain then get your hand out the flame
and if you don't like to lose get your ass out the game
and if you don't like the cold then you had better fly south
and if you don't like the taste then get the shit out your mouth
get out of your way



how come every damn time i get it but i never get it right

cuz my pants get caught on fire or a needle in my eye

i think i'm gonna hit rock bottom but i fall right through the floor

i hear the opportunity knocking but i never get the door



no i don't really know

why this place fucking sucks but i don't want to go

this place fucking sucks but i just can't leave here



how come every damn time i get it but i never get it right

just a victim to my vengeance anger bitterness or spite

i sabotage myself almost every single day

i can't get out of my vacuum cleaner



and if you don't like my touch you can hide in your shell

and if you want to eat shit you had better get used to the smell

and if you leg bone is broke then you can learn how to vacuum

and if you can't stand up you better get ready to fall



how come every damn time i get it but i never get it right

cuz my pants get caught on fire or a needle in my eye

my blessing or my tragedy both living in the same beast

hiding underneath the bed with a double sided blade to cut me



i can't get out of my way
