set out to sail the seven seas we sailed everywhere
we where we pleased but when the storm was coming towards
i noticed you jumping overboard
Lord what to do when the waves are high when to let it go
when to stay ant try did you have to burn the whole thing down

how'd you swim away while i was left to drown

its just not right



when the ship wrecked and it was all done

i know you were afraid and wanted to run

but did you ever turn you head to see

what was happening to me



passing time the eye can see

the way that fate can fuck with me

but all that anger all the hell

i only brought upon myself



i saw god smile when i surfed between

the waves that crashed around me in St. Augustine

i heard god cry when i yelled that night

you didn't even try, try to put up a fight

Lord what to do when the waves are high

pray to let it go and forgive it all

i heard god cry when i yelled that night

i always have to be so fucking right
