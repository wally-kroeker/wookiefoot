every damn day when i get home
my head is ringing like the phone 
sanctuary is all i need
but then i see you rotting there
lazy boy with sega stare
bong sucking leech that makes me bleed

because you take it and you take it

and you never give it back

always dirtying my dishes

always snaking on my snacks

i gotta ask myself why am i still here

are you still here?!?!



this apartment like a living hell

prison riot in a jail cell

what on earth is that annoying smell

can't you tell?

my roommate sucks



every damn day when you get home 

i wish you'd just leave me alone

can't you give your mouth a rest

i know it is a mortal sin

but i did not wash this fork again

are you going to stick it in my chest

because you give it and you give it

and its driving me insane

i gotta take another bong hit

just to cope while you complain

i gotta ask myself why am i still here

are you still here?!?!



and then i bring home a six pack

and he sparks up a bowl

a brief moment of forgiveness

and then he has the nerve 

to smoke and drink it all



my roommate sucks
