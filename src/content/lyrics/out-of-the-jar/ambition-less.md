When he pulls back his bow

And lets his arrow go

With no target he can make no mistake

But with a bull's eye staring

And too much caring

For trophies and medals he might be wearing

The archer's hand will tremble and shake



Move your ass or just get out the way

Gotta get it all done yesterday

Push it to the redline

Take it to the deadline

Make it faster more efficient

If I fall behind I'll never get a piece of mind

I gotta scrap and claw and climb

Because I'm running out of time

Ambition Less Ambition Less Ambition



The realm of (?), true artist, the saint, the philosopher is rarely achieved. Why so few?



One night on Easter Island, the king he had a dream

Offer the gods a giant stone head

(Why so few?)

The sculpture was gorgeous

The slavery enormous

They had to cut down every tree in the forest

A few years later everyone was dead



When he pulls back his bow

And lets his arrow go

With no target he can make no mistake

But with a bull's eye staring

And too much caring

For trophies and medals he might be wearing

The archer's hand will tremble and shake



Move your ass or just get out the way

Gotta get it all done yesterday

Push it to the redline

Take it to the deadline

Make it faster more efficient

If I fall behind I'll never get a piece of mind

I gotta scrap and claw and climb

Because I'm running out of time
