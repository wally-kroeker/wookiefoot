Time now to let go all that you gotta
little by little the whole enchilada
step out the pot hole dropping the bottle
ass in the saddle handle the throttle
man made a statue carved with a chisel
god took the exit world start to fizzle
down come the drizzle to drip on the fragile
those who survive it are mentally agile
And on the eighth day they came
coming down to wash the brain
try to climb inside every kind of mind
they could attain
and a dollar was their sign
and their numbers had grown
falling on the bottom line
like fire and brimstone singing

BUY FEAR GOD TELEVISION
OVERWEIGHT ASSIMILATE CONSUMPTION
INVEST RETIRE EXPIRE BUY THE BOOK
JESUS SAVES FROM THE GRAVE
NO ONE BELIEVES IN

Like a disease they cannot stop
chopping the trees killing the crop
democracy’s a paid off cop
down on his knees sucking a stock
of corporate needs you never to talk
never to read only to walk
to old navy gotta go shop
half priced tees are really hot
Mentally ill it’s on the rise
it lies in how they advertise
they televise and westernize
immortalize the super-size
and my eye spies 3000 advertisements a day
and you’re trying to tell me I’m still sane
