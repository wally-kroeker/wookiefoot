There is a collage of photographs on the wall
Of people at the party in a drunk ass pose
The sticky wood floor starts to vibrate
The DJ turns it up and the energy grows
A collage of photographs on the wall
Light from a nearby beer sign glows
And all of this time
All of these words
All of these people
Getting wasted
Here I am in the same place again
Like a recurring dream with no end
The crowd drifts in like a herd with no direction
Grazing on the meaningless stale conversation
There’s a line for the keg even though it’s been dead
But nobody wants to think that’s just too far ahead
And the mistake that I make is to try to come awake
In a place you’re supposed to get shitfaced or baked
And everybody’s talking and nobody’s listening
And nobody’s feeling that something is missing
Let’s just pound another one in the name of having fun
Let’s just burn another one in the name of having…
It’s just not that fun

She slams another shot so she won’t be afraid
When she trades in lonely for a night to get laid
He slams another shot so he won’t be afraid
If you don’t want to see your shadow
you can hide in the shade
It just feels so good to be touched
And it doesn’t matter who at least not that much
And everybody’s talking and nobody’s listening
And nobody’s feeling that something is missing
And everybody’s talking and nobody’s listening
And nobody’s feeling but somebody’s missing
I don’t want to laugh no I don’t want another beer
Lord take me away from here
Slide outside into the cold under the stars
And I think about just where you are and it kills me
