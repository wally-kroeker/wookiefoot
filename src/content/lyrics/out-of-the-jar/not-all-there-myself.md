You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself...

My main message is uh...use you're head
Completely tripped out...d*** right!

But I don't want to go among mad people!
Whatever will I do?

I have an excellent idea!

Let's take the time...

We're turned on, and we're tuned in, and we're very dropped out
