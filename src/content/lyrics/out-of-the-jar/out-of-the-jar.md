When I was a boy, I used to sing a song in the temple

And you'll find that most of the flies will not be able to get out of the jar
They've made a commitment that that's the limit of their universe
And you'll find that most of the flies will not be able to get out of the jar
Most get stuck
Get out of the jar
Get out of the jar

Natural explanation
