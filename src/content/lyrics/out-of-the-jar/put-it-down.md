Not again, I feel the knot again

I feel the knot again gotta make it stop again

I really wish we could just take it back to the top again

spiral like a chromosome throwing every stick and stone

but words that really hurt are what breaks the bone

and I know you've heard it all before

but I gotta put in my foot before your mind has time to close the door

please little darling believe me when I say everything will be okay

If we put it down and come out with our hands up

you gotta put it down and come out with your hands up

I gotta put it down now and come out with my hands up

my hands up

It's getting harder now than when we started out

but the road less traveled on is what it's all about

BANG on the door think you need a place to hide

All the time you're knocking you've been knocking from the inside

And I know and I know that if we put it down

Then we would be a you and me the poetry would be about

Please little monkey believe me when I say

Everything will be okay
