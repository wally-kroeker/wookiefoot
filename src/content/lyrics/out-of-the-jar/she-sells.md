See how she sells sex by the sea shore

All bow down to the super model virgin whore

Look long enough and you'll pay a price you can't afford

It only makes you want it more

It only makes you want it more

And now I know that what you got you cannot get

Cause you airbrushed her body and she's got fake tits

Got a diet, I'll try it while I'm feeling unfit

Feed me the bulls*** I'll buy it

Feed me the bulls***

While helpless little girl seeks single white male

Bombarded with the thought she's dependent and frail

And worth inverse to what she weighs on a scale

Make the lady feel needy self esteem is on sale



(See how she sells sex by the sea shore)

See how she sells

(All bow down to the super model virgin whore

Look long enough and you'll pay a price you can't afford)

See how she sells

(It only makes you want it more

It only makes you want it more)

(See how she sells sex by the sea shore)

See how she sells

(All bow down to the super model virgin whore

Look long enough and you'll pay a price you can't afford

It only makes you want it more

It only makes you want it more)



See how she sells dumb as a rock

And it's all just an act and the fact is they flock

To illusions of skin deep cracked when she talked

And intelligence slipped off the lip what a shock



While everyday Barbie gets thrown in the face

Of bulimic little girls of all different shapes

Who watch T.V. to make themselves feel bad

About whatever little fat they had. (they had)



See how she sells sex by the sea shore

All bow down to the super model virgin whore

Look long enough and you'll pay a price you can't afford

It only makes you want it more

It only makes you want it more



(See how she sells sex by the sea shore)

See how she sells

(All bow down to the super model virgin whore

Look long enough and you'll pay a price you can't afford)

See how she sells

(It only makes you want it more

It only makes you want it more)

(See how she sells sex by the sea shore)

See how she sells

(All bow down to the super model virgin whore

Look long enough and you'll pay a price you can't afford

It only makes you want it more

It only makes you want it more)



The Goddess they bought us the female of the species

Are you the Virgin Mary or are you just cheap and easy

Telling us this is what's beautiful this is what's hot

Buy this buy that you get what they got.

The subliminal so criminal tunnel deep inside my brain

Train of thought off track mark needles in vain

With vanity insanity made a slave to the mirror

Trust me there is no salvation in that my dear.



I relinquish their rights to myself self worth

All rights reserved, Sisters rise up... its time for a rebirth
