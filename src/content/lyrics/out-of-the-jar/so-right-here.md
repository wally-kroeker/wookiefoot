moverator verbarator

got you into out control

move your ass for this will pass

time will surely take its toll

out of bounds and in and out

of knocking all around

feel the heartfelt yearning

turning quest for

higher ground

at least mentally

hopeful floats of energy

come requesting to be

moving frequently

no time abound

but the time right now

speak out for peace and

speak out for sound

this seems so right here

pack up your bones and

move your fast feet

if you're on the gravel then

you're on the right street

the sun and the flowers

never smelled so sweet

we're aligned with the moon

and we're fluid with the sea

and if you take the smoke

i diagnose it heavily

to comatose moments

hopes and destinies

and if there ever was

a moments memory to freeze

screaming at the waves

coming washing over me

this seems so right here

this seems so right here

feel this warmth right here

this seems so right here
