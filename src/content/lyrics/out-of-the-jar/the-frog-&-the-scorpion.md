Mr. scorpion came down to the riverside

getting across he knew he would need a ride

but all the other animals go running for shelter

cuz they know for a fact that its the same as suicide

With good cause no one ever trusted him

help him out theyd be stuck out on a limb

cuz everybody knows that a scorpion will kill

about anything just upon a whim

Scorpion said, Mr. frog, Mr. frog oh, please!!

if I had them Id be down on my knees

Mr. frog let me ride on your back

and I vow on my life that ill never attack (Please? NO! Please? NO!)

Get your lying arachnid ass up and go

youre not that quick and Im not that slow

but you really did put on a nice show

Take me across the river

and no harm will come to you

if I ever stung you know that I would die too

Scorpion turned his back said appreciated all the help

thank you sir but I guess Ill just go drown myself

he tried to aggravate the stalemate with some guilt

in an amphibious assault to frustrate and the frog said

Wait wait now, dont be talking crazy man

though my mom said never trust a scorpion

its just not humane to watch a person in pain

but theres just one thing Ive got to explain

I will take you across the river

but be careful what you do

if you ever stung me know that

you would die too

And the frog said,

take me for granted I asked for its all my fault

When the frog got stung POW right in the back

though he vowed on his life he would never attack

he got stung POW right in the back

with famous last words the frog had to ask

why would you do that, how could you lie

when I know that you know that were both going to die

and the scorpion just smiled and said with pride

its in my nature you stupid dumb ass M$%#@! frog
