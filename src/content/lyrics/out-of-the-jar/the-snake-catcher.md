Hunter goes to the sacred ground
up on a mountain see the man spellbound
king of the snakes is what he found
but it didn’t make a motion didn’t make one sound
wrapped the serpent up in a holy shroud
throw it on his back bring it back to town
set a stage up for a fearful crowd
people will come from miles around
women and children singing oh my lord
all the people running screaming oh my lord
everybody gather both rich and poor and
more and more and more come pouring
crowd starts roaring sun comes shining
sound and lights will stir the giant
snake awake and people crying
ropes are broken people dying
terrified and paralyzed the ground starts to shake
and everybody running frantically the fear will overtake
and an intoxicated ego always makes the mistake
hunters getting crushed in the mouth of the snake
