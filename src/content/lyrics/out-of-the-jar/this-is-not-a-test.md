And if you seek it know that it will never come
and if you seek it know that it will never come
under your toes is where the greenest grass grows
but becomes like a desert when your
feet start getting numb so I come…
with no fear for the future
with no chains from the past
if your wishing for that mission
lash yourself to the mast
you know that Ram Das said to
be here right now
you know that Chang Tzu and Rumi said to
be here right now
This moment is forever so
put it down and take a look around
and take in all you found
I’m naked making all this sound
get crazy pants and dance around
pound footprints into the ground
life’s a verb and not a noun
know this life is not a test
this is not a test
