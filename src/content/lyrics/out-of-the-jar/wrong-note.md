There’s a note that’s not right in this song
And every time it comes around it always seems to bring me down
And everyday I hope and pray that God will make it go away
This note that’s not right in this song
There’s a tone in her voice that’s not right
And every time I come around i only seem to bring her down
One day I overheard her pray for God to make me go away
This tone in her voice that’s not right
There’s a sun in the sky that’s not right
And every time it comes around I close my eyes till it’s going down
The perfection in my head each day makes all the good ones go away
Oh Lord, heed my call, send a flood to wash it all away
The tone in her voice
The note in this song
That’s not right
