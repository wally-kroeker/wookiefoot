[Intro]
[Verse]
It all started one day with a thought
And then the thought became a word
The word turned into an action before it was even heard
And then the action come every now and again
Until it soon become a habit when
The ability to discern your will is slowly getting blurred
How did I get here nobody did force me
I must have brought myself
And I can see all around me all this pain and misery
How did I ever create this hell
But I can hear my guardian angle scream
[Chorus]
If you're going through hell don't stop (don't stop)
If you're going through hell don't stop (don't stop)
In the darkest night a sliver still shines
So pick up your head and walk
If you're going through hell don't stop
[Interlude]
[Verse]
Oh thought becomes word and word becomes action
Action turned into habit it's just habitual chain reaction
Of thought becoming word and word becoming action
Action turn into habit got to break that chain reaction
Of thought, I thought therefore I was locked in a prison of my own mind
And there's many miles to go on the road to Shangri-La
But I know I'm gonna find it in my own time
