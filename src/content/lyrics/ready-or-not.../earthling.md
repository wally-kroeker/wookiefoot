I'm an earthling and you're a earthling

And we're evolving now so we all sing

That I'm an earthling and you're a earthling

I see a beautiful new day dawning



We got to battle the alienation

Help the people isolated by division

Come to remind them that it's all collaboration

And smash all the self imposed prisons

No more solitary confinement

See the light being split by the prism

But we can get it all back into alignment

Oh people of the Earth please listen!



Cause we're down to Earth

We're down to Earth

So dig your toes in the dirt

'Cause it all comes down to Earth



An alien is just a human being alienated

With their hearts and mind separated

And their nature devastated

Coming with a planetary invasion

Earthlings rise against the alien-nation



I'm a terrestrial being and not the extra kind

And I can see all the pollution so I must remind

That the only way possible to make it all sustainable

Is that we recognize that our fates are tied



The Earth is not given to you by your parents

It is loaned to you by your children

The Earth is not given to you by your parents

It is loaned to you by your children's children



To all my Nature Freaks... To all my Freaks of Nature...

Everybody that you see is an Earthling

And all the animals and trees are Earthlings

And even though that we know that they can't speak

Make a choice for the voiceless, everybody sing...



You can try, you can try, to build it wide, to build it high

But you'll never move faster than the speed of Earth
