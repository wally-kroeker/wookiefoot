So many people in this world so much suffering
I see the river on fire the mountain crumbling
I put my ear to the earth hear it rumbling
Which way will we go
People always say it doesn't matter anyway
Closing the heart cause they see it every day
But not this time we're going not afraid
Marching on even though we know

We will go through shadows
Fear will always justify
Even lead a good heart down to aggression
Come to know it's so simple
If love is not the answer then we just asked the wrong question

Don't get me wrong, I can see just how it happens now
Seeds of doubt falling around empathy is shutting down
All of the hatred in the world see where it comes from
From defending a god or a job or a loved one
Apathy's a pathogen only wants to spread
The longest journey ever's from the heart to the head
Like Theseus in the maze following the thread
The longest journey ever's from the heart to the head

Oh just got to remind the mind
Kindness coming back to human kind
To find your heart you got to lose your mind
To find your heart you got to lose your mind
