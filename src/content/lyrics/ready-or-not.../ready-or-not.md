As you walk along your road
Try to find out just which way to go
If the trail is clear your probably on someone else's path
So to the woods you go
Deep into the darkness and the great unknown
Blaze through the maze
Until you come upon a place that's not your future or your past
You walk up to the chasm's edge now
And jumping is the only way across
Those who seek are never lost

Doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter where you go
That cycle just keeps on spinning just as long as your alive
And at times you will be high and at times you will be low
Just remember that when you are falling turn it into a dive

Out in the world following your bliss
Relax the hand open up your fist
Still always coming back to this black abyss
You know is a sacred space
The fates lead who will
All those who won't will just get dragged still
Time to let go of the life you planned
To go with the one that awaits
We're born with wings but do we crawl
This abyss is where we learned to fly
The bottom's where your treasure lies
The bottom's where your treasure lies so dive
Oh Mahakala I will surrender
Ready or not I will surrender

Now is the time to get up and rise
And learn to convert the inertia of the dive
Put your hands up in the sky, no more need to try
I will surrender now
In the abyss you know the bliss always rises
Power of the now is the people harmonizing
Earthlings sing feel the world energize!
I will surrender now see less
