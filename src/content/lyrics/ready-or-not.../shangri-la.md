It's a leap of faith it's just a leap of faith

If you want to find this place

You've got to take a leap of faith

A mind tied in knots can never believe

A hand in a fist clench can not receive

We're lifting up the veil to see

That it's always been just beneath the own to feet



And I'm gonna make it and your gonna make it too

Cause you got me and I got you



Shangri-La, Shangri-La

On the road to Shangri-La

Seek and you will find

When you look out of your mind

We all reunite at Shangri-La



In this hurricane of experience

You are the roots that I hold on to

And no storm shall ever break this foundation

Of this tribe that we belong to



And i'm gonna make it and you're gonna make it too

Cause you got me and I got you



I got you I got you I got you know that I got you

And I can see you get me too

The only way we make it through

I got you I got you I got you know that I got you

And I can see that you get me too

It's the only way we'll make it through to



Shangri-La!
