You don't need my help with your surrender
You don't need a hand to draw your armies down
With your armoured divisions and your angry thoughts
The battle could be over now with just one sound
And it goes like this

Sweet Silence

All your plastic alters and your worries
All of your illusions now of solid ground
Stack up with my brick up inside your castle walls
But blessed bliss will be the day when it all comes down
And it sounds like this

You don't have to be that smart to do it
But you gotta be stupid if you don't
Isn't it crazy that we would know
A medicine that could heal the whole wide world
But we're so lazy we just won't
Try to find silence

You don't need my help with your surrender
You don't need a hand to draw your armies down
The war is over if you want it to be
So come on my sisters and brothers we got to
Listen to our Mother because one way or another
We are all destined to be
Returned to silence...
