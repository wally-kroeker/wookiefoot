And it's them vs. us and us vs. them
And a battle cry always seems to get an amen
And it's them vs. us and us vs. them
What you believe is what you receive

But what if it turned out to be
That we are they and they are we
All of this dichotomy is just a false conspiracy
What if it turned out to be there really is no enemy
What you believe is what you receive

Because you see love in in all or you don't seek love at all
You see love in all or you don't seek love at all
(Sing it with your enemy!)
Because you see love in in all or you don't seek love at all
You see love in all or you don't seek love at all

With everybody fueling it the fire will blaze
And crazed by the flames all the flags raised
Look into the face of the rage flame will illuminate
Keep the karma coming spinning in place
So let's all ask stupid questions
And question stupid actions
Because the fact is that factions are fearful reactions
And just fictitious distractions
