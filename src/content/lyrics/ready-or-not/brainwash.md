[Intro]
(This boy and girl are going to be well equipped when the time comes to take their places as worthy members of adult society)
[Verse]
My brain is awash in a sea of misery
Over stimulated overly complicated from the info-tainment
No brother to blame man
Just wondering where the people who are sane went
Now
[Refrain]
Alpha beta delta theta
(Alpha beta delta theta)
Brain waves up like a storm in a sеa
Alpha beta delta theta
(Alpha bеta delta theta)
Move through the consciousness unconsciously
[Verse]
Got to take it apart look at it now give it a flip and then ripping it out
Wash your brain and make it count
Brainstorms clear the clouds
Of mental hand me downs, gotta get off of the merry-go-round
Synaptic gap connected now
Won't you help me sing it loud
