Please don't walk behind me because I really shouldn't lead you
And don't walk to far ahead cause it's hard to follow
Let's just walk side by side and everything will be alright
If I wake up in your arms tomorrow
If I wake up in your arms tomorrow

Oh someday, someday when we are old and gray
And all our time is only time we've borrowed
Everyday I will say, everything will be alright
If I can wake up in your arms tomorrow
Lord let me wake up in your arms tomorrow

We will walk through the dark of night
We will see the monsters eyes
You and me we laugh all the while
Cause we can fly

And when your feeling down
I'll lay down on the ground with you
And sing a song to help dispel your sorrow
So just take me by the hand
Everything is gonna be alright
When you wake up in my wake my arms tomorrow
Oh when you wake up in my arms tomorrow
