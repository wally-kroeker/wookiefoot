This here's the story
Life is the story, and this one is mine
I write the dialogue as I speak and the actions as I move
The same is true for all men
Though few ever choose to cast themselves as the villain
Many choose to be the victim or even worse, the bystander
But in this story, I am the hero
And as this is a great and unlikely story
I must do great and unlikely things
Only a fool sits by while the music plays
(And thank you for riding Wookiefoot)
