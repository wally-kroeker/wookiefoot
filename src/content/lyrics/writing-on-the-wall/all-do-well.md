(Intro)
If we were out to sea and lost on a lifeboat
Would you throw me overboard when you heard supply low
Making me a scapegoat, blaming it on fate though
We both know that no one survives alone
Greed empire, golden spire, standing tall, before they fall
Need to work together now, they thinkin' small, building walls
Urgency that's clear to me, know that we all, get the call
Won't somebody please pick up the phone
Because we only go as fast as the slowest
Wе only get as rich as the poorest
And you'rе not just a lone tree, but part of a forest
We all love your solo, but please join the chorus singin'
(Chorus)
All do well, will we all do well
Yeah we all (All do well, yeah we all do well)
Will we all do well, will we all do well
Yeah we all (All do well, yeah we all do well)
(Please check your number, or please call again)
(This is a recording)
(We're sorry)
