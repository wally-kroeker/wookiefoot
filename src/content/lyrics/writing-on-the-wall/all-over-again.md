(Intro)
On a dirt road, headed off into the forest
Ocean beaches stretch out before us
Maybe for a while we'll call it home
The sounds of the jungle wake us at dawn
Hum of the city all long gone
Crashing waves call us out beyond our comfort zones
I watch her dancing there in the sand
Holding her own, holding my hand
Moving like light on the water, she look like a goddess
Give thanks for what brought us to this holy land
Who is this girl, who could she be
Why did she ever choose to come with mе
Into this wild and deep uncertainty
(Bridge)
Cause whеn you travel life unravels
Face your demons, face your battles
Find your darkness, and shine your light
And on that road of many highs
And many lows the only thing I know
I can't imagine you not by my side
