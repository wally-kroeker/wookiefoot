(Intro)
I'm so happy to be here, yeah
I'm just happy to be here
(Intro Chorus)
Still I know the world's on fire
The situation's dire
A lot of work and courage gunna be required but
I'm just happy to be here
(Verse)
I'm sure there's many versions, inside this multiverse
Where I put it in forward, instead of in reversal
The technical skill, I neglected to rehearse
Understandably landed mе, handedly into a world of hurt
It could be worse, I could bе cursed to be
Living a life, stuck on a different time line
Where I never find time to discover my path
And never asked, the questions that I needed to ask
And never signed the bottom line on my soul contract
(Bridge)
And the multiple me's, that just might be
Insignificant in this infinity
We're still strummin' the chords on a string theory
The only thing that's clear to me
Is
