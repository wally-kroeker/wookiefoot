(Verse)
To my son
I haven't met
I need to warn you that
We're gunna be best friends
Thick or thin, sink or swim, lose or win
We can battle in the castle with the dragon
And back in a
A rocket ship
Into the sky
We're gunna cry till we laugh
And laugh till we cry
You and I
You will ride, right on time, time
Try to slow it down as years roll by
And by the way
There's gunna be some times
I'll have to go away
Just for a little while
But while I'm gone
Don't be scared when that darkness comes
Always remember that
(Chorus)
When there's monsters under your bed
Don't be afraid son, know that it's all in your head
When you've had enough
Turn around chuck 'em down go give that monster some love
