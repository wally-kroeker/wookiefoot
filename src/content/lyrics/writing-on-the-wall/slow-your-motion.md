Slow, your motion
Roll like the ocean
Slowin' down time just like a magical potion
Slow, your motion
Let go your notion
Transcend fourth dimension with that love and devotion
(Verse)
Life is so short
People are telling me all of the time
But we can't ignore
The way that we choose to be living our lives
World's spinnin', busy and pace
Soul, fin, running in place
Searching it for, a way to get out
Run outta time to run into now
That's in past and future tense
Here and now we're staring in
Forever to my never when the hour glass just tips again
Gotta stay cool like Solo
Put on my ring disappear like Frodo
Be ready to get back my mojo
(If I can flip my mode to slow-mo) (Here we go)
