(Intro)
How I wonder what you are
How I wonder what you are
I caught your tiny body, in the palm of my hand
I could barely understand, I could barely understand
Like diamonds fallin' from the sky
Like diamonds fallin' from the sky
Miracles will fall around us, bursting into life
It may have given you yours, but you sure saved mine
And I know I can't freeze time
And we all get scars on this ride
But no matter how far, or how great the divide
I know
I know she'll be fine, cause
Though she is small, she is fierce
Though she is small, small, small
She is fierce, so fierce and
Objects in the mirror are so much larger than they appear
Though she is small
She is fierce
(Verse)
Up above the world so high
Up above the world so high
But a time will come when you must go
Out in the world, out on your own
But you'll never be alone my darlin'
Never alone
