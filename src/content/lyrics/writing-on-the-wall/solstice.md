There's a darkness so deep
That it crawls underneath my door
It comes into my sleep
You know I've never been down here before
All the water turn to stone now
Feelin' isolated with these cold winds blowin' down
To all the people locked inside their homes
When I see a light on I know I'm not alone
The darkest hour, of the darkest day
Of the hardest year we'll ever have to face
We made it to thе solstice, this coldness
Our souls must go fight on
Can you hear thеir call to a song
Turn your light on
(Turn your light on)
Feel the wheel, turning round
Suddenly the days are getting longer
And the sun is returning now
I can feel us all getting stronger
We're still a long way to go so
Pray for the know how
Unequally we pay the cost
Give some love for the ones on the front lines
And a prayer to the ones that we've lost
