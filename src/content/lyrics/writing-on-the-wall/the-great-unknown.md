(Intro)
I'm so certain, I'm so certain all the time
I'm just so absolutely positive
That everything I'm thinking is right
And everybody's so certain
Behind the curtain of their mind
And the benefit of doubt just gets drowned out
In the shouts of a world with just two sides
(Verse)
Welcome, my friend, to the new age
No book we can look for the same page
Nobody is searching for inner peace
Just everyone loving the outrage
But I feel you, cause it pains us
But our wounding, so contagious
And I cannot say you're necessarily wrong
Cause it really is fucking outrageous
The thought becoming frigid
And the synapse getting rigid
And they're closing mind
On all sides
See em conquer and divide
Embrace the ambiguity
The wonder and the mystery
That certainty will certainly hide
