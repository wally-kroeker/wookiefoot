Lost in this wilderness one more time
Hear the growl of the beast not far behind
Run run to a cliff, find a vine climb down try to hide
Look below and see another pair of hungry eyes
It may seem like suffering is fate
But a fruit grows from the vine
How sweet it taste now
(Chorus)
And I'm sorry, I know, I can be difficult sometimes
But the hard way, is the only way, I ever seem to find
Well I may go, I may go too far
But it's, in the darkness I can see the stars
There's only two ways to learn in this life
When we get, burned by the fire, or
We see the light, help me see the light
Starin' at the cloud as the rain pours down
Shake my fist at the sky and I scream out loud
Drown in my doubt now
Now the cloud says son you can sit here
Soakin' in the rain and just complain about the Leviathan
Or you can seek out the shelter of a tree
In the silence and the peace you might discover what you're hiding from
