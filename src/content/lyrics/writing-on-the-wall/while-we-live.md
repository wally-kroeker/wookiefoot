I wish I knew a blessing
For a time like right now
I know you're in pain, but you'll figure it out
I did it to be simple
And not over profound
Just a poem to remind you to put that weight down
Put that weight down
Well tonight, yes tonight
We've got nothing up but time
So lets keep this fire burnin'
Until that sun comes around
Well tonight, oh tonight
Let no water flow under bridges
Light a chalice of forgiveness
For the ones that we burn down
Cause it's a long road
And we've got to lighten our load
And figure out, how
To put it all down
And listen to the sound of what's happening now
And sing
