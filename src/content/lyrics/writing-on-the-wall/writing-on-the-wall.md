(Intro)
Recently I've been thinking of you
My great-grandchild
How insane it became to explain what we're going through
And these days my mind can run wild
So I thought it would better if I wrote it in a letter to you
Dear great-grand kids
I wanna try to explain what we did to your planet
And damn it, I know it's hard to understand it
But the fact is, we failed to take action and
Acted like manic generational bandits
And I'm sure you gotta couple of questions like
What were you thinking and what was your intention
But, sadly this message is just a confession about
How we failеd the test and nevеr learned our damn lesson
You know your ancestors worked in the coal mine
Never havin' money, never had time
Never see the sun, poisoning the land with the fumble
Mostly die from black lung, just to provide for they young and
Now everybody thinkin' that we doing all the best that we can
We, do it for our families
Never understanding what we did
(You can't starve your grand-children, just to feed your kids)
