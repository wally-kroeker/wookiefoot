You are your mother
And you are your father
You are the beauty and disaster
Of all your ancestors
And you, you come to life
We are our grandmothers
And we are our grandfathers
We are the comedy
We are the tragedy
The actor and the author
And we, we come to life
We come to life
You can take this seed and smash it open and still you'll never find
The oak tree hiding inside
Said yeah you can take this seed and
Smash it into bits and still never find
The oak tree hiding inside yeah
Dream repeated and a dream retold
Passed along the patterns in the epigenome
Sometimes it feels so damn controlled
But now it's time to wake up
All these roots of thought just weigh me down
I can see there my way out
Voices from the past start to shout
It's time to make them all (?)
