[Intro]
Hey you
Your your life is yours to create

Hey you
Yours to create
Yours to create
(Yeah)

[Verse]
I'm the Man of La Mancha
I can see the dragon
Lying in a circle, devouring its tail
We come from La Mancha
Tribe of the Earthlings
Swim through the madness
Time to set sail, wake up

Where you taking us now
It's a choose your own adventure
It's your turn at the wheel

Learnin' that you're the creator but what are you makin'
Awakin' in shackles but easily break 'em
Igniting the light of the mind manifesting
Pure imagination

Bad Bunny - DtMF (English Translation)
Genius English Translations
You will feel the weight of all Samsara's chains
(Samsara's chains)
When you change the way you see the world
The world you see will change

[Chorus]
So dream, impossible dreams
Fight, unbeatable foes
Go, no matter how far
(No matter how far, just go)

Yeah dream, impossible dreams
Fight, unbeatable foes
Go, no matter how far
Reach the unreachable stars

[Interlude]
We'll return into dust
We'll return into stars
We'll return into us
We'll turn into stars
We'll return
We'll return

[Verse]
I'm the Man of La Mancha
I can see the dragon
Lyin' in a circle, devouring its tail
We come from the La Mancha
Tribe of the Earthlings
Swim through the madness
Time to set sail, rise up
Feel the energy rise
Don Quixote only had his lonely self to rely

But we got insanity with the community
Out on the ocean a modern day odyssey
Saddle your horse get ready for battle
Storm the sand castle

And you will face the night of mirrors on your way
(Samsara's chains)
When you change the way you see the world
The world you see will change

[Chorus]
So dream, impossible dreams
Fight, unbeatable foes
Go, no matter how far
Reach the unreachable stars

[Interlude]

Your life is yours to create

[Chorus]
Dreaming the impossible
Beating the unbeatable
Believing it to be and
See us reaching the unreachable
Dreaming the impossible
Beating the unbeatable
Believing it to be and
See us reaching the unreachable

Stars
We'll return into dust
We'll return into stars
We'll return into us
We'll turn into stars

[Outro]
We'll return into dust
We'll return into stars
We'll return into us
We'll turn into stars
We'll return
We'll return
