I might have lost my mind
Will you help me, my friend?
I can't quite tell where it is that I end
And you begin
I feel insane
I can't explain it
But I know in my heart that
Everyone is greater than the sum of their parts
The candle may go out but there's a spark in the darkness
Burn for a moment and returns

This body
This body
Everybody's nobody
Just illusions
Dancing on cell walls
Look behind the eyes to find
The light inside
And realize that everybody's nobody at all

I can feel the tilt of the axis starting to shift
I can hear the spirit singing voices lift
Now change is coming from the roots to the leaves
And Buddha and Shiva and the elephant agree
A chain reaction of compassion from the ashes of greed
Is coming to set us free

This body
This body
Everybody's nobody
Just illusions
Dancing on cell walls
Look behind the eyes to find
The light inside
And realize that everybody's nobody at all

Everybody's nobody
Everybody's nobody
Everybody's nobody at all
