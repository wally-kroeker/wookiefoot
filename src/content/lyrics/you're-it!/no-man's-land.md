Hold the die, your turn to roll

Before they fall through your fingers

Not a good night to lose control

Right as the earth is unraveling

You play with your blocks until they break

And these walls come tumbling down

Oh, they're tumbling down



You're out of time, make your move

Live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back



Kiss your perfect day goodbye

Because the world is on fire

Tuck your innocence goodnight

You sold your friends like guns for hire

Go play with your blocks

And now you'll pay when these walls come tumbling down

Oh, they're tumbling down



Resting on a knife, you heavy souls

With all this weight buckling down on you now

Don't you drown and float away

Not a good time to lose control

Right as your marionettes cut their strings and run away



You're out of time, make your move

Live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back



Kiss your perfect day goodbye

Because the world is on fire

Tuck your innocence goodnight

You sold your friends like guns for hire

Go play with your blocks

And now you'll pay when these walls come tumbling down

Oh, they're tumbling down
