Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
They say it's all going down, yeah all gone down
But from your center you can see it's just going up and around
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Feel the breath within the breath
Take it in and take it down underground
Feel the rhythms flowing down to the speed of sound
Worry, will not take away your trouble tomorrow
Only take away your peace, today
Worry, will not take away your pain, your sorrow
Bring it back to the breath and it can all melt away
Give in, give out
Give in, give out
No longer lookin' outward for what lies inside
Don't need to ever cut or sever what can be untied
How in the world, does it change
How in the world, does it change
The answer always seems to be the same
The answer always seems to be the same
Don't hold your breath
