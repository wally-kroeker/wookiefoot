[Intro]
(Oh we gotta keep it light)
(Oh we gotta keep it light)
Gotta keep it light
We gotta keep it light
[Verse]
These illusions, just optical
Like Ganesha, I move the obstacle
I fight through my depression
Lost inside the grave
But the clouds will part and the sun does shine some day
She told me service is the way
Scent of the rose lingers long on the hand
Of the person that gives it away
[Bridge]
But sometimes my shadows do return
I just turn towards the sun and they fall behind me
We make peace
Cause it's you and it's me
We gotta elevate each other
Brother sister come and sing it loud now
