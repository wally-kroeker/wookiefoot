Who are you?
The questions just echo
Echo
Trapped in this sandcastle and
Needing to let go
Let go
Can anyone hear me now?
Can anyone hear me now?
Fanatical phone addicts
Lack eye contact as a tactic
Pupils glued to their screens
Beam out to the cyber galactic
And real life now seems so damn anticlimactic
Everyone′s a stranger
Hiding inside higher tax brackets
I don't want my intelligence to be artificial or
Someone telling me selling me it′s more beneficial so
Slow down ahead
This curve goes exponential with
Catestrophic unintential consequence potential
Who are we now?
Who are we now?
All I hear on the news is about Iranian Uranium
And how everybody loses when they're invading the Ukranians
They're enslaving the third world natives
And they call it saving them
Hype the dose of my utopian is coped with pain inside my cranium
I just gotta calm down
I need more patience
But my heart just doesn′t resound with the sound of technological salvation
The distance between the new nations
The people on the ground and the space stations
At this acceleration just seems bound for devestation
It′s starting to feel like this is
All just a simulation
The sky painted on the ceiling
And plastic vegetation
We're all looking for something with meaning
What it means to be a human
What it means to just be humans being
Who are we now?
Who are we now?
And I don′t even understand the idea
Of nature versus nurture
If humans are just animals
Then isn't it just a merger?
When did civilization even decide on its departure
If we don′t nuture nature we're just wrecking our own future
And the jungles are concrete
People feed on bipolarity
Medicating away all the clarity
So that there will be
Never a hope for solidarity
And apparently nature fades into obscurity
As we tragically and rapidly head for the singularity
Who are you?
The questions just echo
Echo
Trapped in this sandcastle and
Needing to let go
Let go
Can anyone hear me now?
Can anyone hear me now?
