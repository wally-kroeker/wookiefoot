By the waters edge, the current running swift
She sat down for a minute trying to catch her breath
She said why am I so alone
Why are we all so alone
The floods came and divided us long ago
Nobody knew how to swim, stranded on islands of their own
She said I will no longer cling, to this shore of isolation anymore
She just jumped on
In the current, pulled and twisted
Knocked on rocks and flipped and lifted
Rolling through the rapids, feel like drowning
Head is pounding, lights surrounding
Starting to float
Starting to float
Drifting with the current, learning not to control
There's no way out, but thеre's a way in
There's no way out, but thеre's a way in-side
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
